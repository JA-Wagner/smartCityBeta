# SmartCity Beta
**Abstract**
SmartCity is an application built for MGIS Inc. as an Algonquin College Applied project over the course of the final semester of the program. 

The back-end was built by @robsonscm, the front-end and integration was built by @ja-wagner and styling was applied and finalized by Michel Toutain and @Rye434 with graphical design work done by Alison Kapcala  

SmartCity is designed to aid users in submitting issues to the "311" departments of enrolled cities to save time and costs for the users and city.
